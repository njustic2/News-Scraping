# News-Scraping
All the News That's Fit to Scrape.

This app lets users view and leave comments on the latest news of some website (as directed by the app) using Mongoose and Cheerio as scraping tools.

The app scraps stories from the websiteâ€™s news article. User do not have to write the article, all they do is scrap the article and it will be displayed. The following can be scraped: Headlines, Short summary articles, URL to the original article, photos, bylines and editorials. 

If you/user scraps an article, it is saved to a database. The article along with comments, if any, are all saved to the database. 

You/users can always return to view what comments and articles or information have been scrapped. 
However, comments are visible to all users making use of the app.
Enjoy.
